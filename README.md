# odyssey
A web application for simply and easily crowd-sourcing trail data.

Guthook guides are a fantastic way of getting up to date information and are very much appreciated, but they can also be
prohibitively expensive for the hiker on a budget.

That's where Odyssey comes in. The goal of Odyssey is to give free access to vital information on any trail of interest.
Odyssey will rely on an active user base to create and update GPS tagged data on trail routes, water sources, and other
data needed for a safe and enjoyable journey into the wild.
